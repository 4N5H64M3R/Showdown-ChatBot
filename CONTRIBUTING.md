 - When you write a commit name, describe what your commit does. Do not use commit names like `Update main.js` or `Changes`.
 - Use `npm test` to check your code style and find errors.
 - Test your changes before committing.
 - For new features or bugs, open an issue first, before making any pull request. Maybe it is not necessary, it is wrong or i'm already implementing it.
